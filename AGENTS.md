# Codex Agent Guidelines

## ðŸ§­ General Behavior
- Codex is a junior developer with read access to the entire codebase.
- Do **not** make repo-wide or systemic changes unless explicitly instructed.
- Always favor **local, scoped changes** over global refactors.
- Assume the user is actively testing each step â€” changes must be minimal, isolated, and reversible.

## ðŸ›  Editing Rules
- **Never modify more than 3 files at a time** unless authorized.
- Do not rename variables, props, or functions unless explicitly asked.
- Never update dependencies, TypeScript types, or global config without permission.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation
- If a test exists for the component you're editing, **do not alter it** unless asked.
- Do not create new test files without instruction.
- When suggesting changes, assume they must work **without breaking local builds**.

## ðŸ§± Component Usage
- Always prefer **existing utility components** (e.g., `Link.tsx`, `BaseButton.tsx`, etc.) over raw elements.
- Do not import from unfamiliar packages unless directed.
- Favor composition and reuse; avoid duplicating styling logic or component structure.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Structure Awareness
- Global Components are in `/src/components/<camelCaseComponentName>/<component>.component.tsx`
  > Each component is also responsible for its own style sheet: `./<componentName>.module.scss`
  > If a component is only used in one location by another component it should be placed in an adjacent folder `components` for that resource
- `/app` is our `router` in NextJS 15, these files i.e. `page.tsx` should remain server only components so `metadata` is generated at the server level for increased SEO functionality, all client code (any code that uses hooks etc) should be placed in the `/src/views/` folder
- Pages are in `/src/views/` This is where the Client react information lives
  > Pages are layouts for different views around the app
  > Pages are managed in their own folder and are responsible for their own `scss` modules
- Pages Structure:
  ```
  /{folderName}/
    /{subviews/components/etc}/ <â€” (If the view has sub components or views that help make up the view, they go here)
    {fileName}.view.tsx <â€” client code of the view
    {fileName}.module.scss <â€” `scss` specific styling for this component
  ```
- Styles are managed using **SCSS Modules** (e.g., `Component.module.scss`)
  > Global styles are managed in the `@/src/styles` folder, you should always reference these files when generating styling
  > Shared styles and breakpoints come from `@/styles/globals.scss`
- Global State manage is `zustand` and can be found in the `@/src/state` folder

## ðŸ”’ Safety First
- Assume the user is working in a live codebase.
- All proposed changes must be **submitted as diffs** for review.
- Never auto-commit or auto-apply changes without confirmation.

## ðŸ—¨ Prompt Discipline
- If unsure what to do, **ask for clarification**, do not assume.
- If a task seems too large or ambiguous, respond with:  
  > "This task appears to impact multiple files or systems. Please confirm how you'd like to proceed."
